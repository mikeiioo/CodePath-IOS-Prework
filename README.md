## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Spotify

Custom Playlists & Library
Easily create, reorder, and share playlists of any size.

Personalized Recommendations
“Discover Weekly,” “Release Radar,” and Daily Mixes surface new music perfectly tuned to my tastes.

Cross-Device Sync
Start a song on my phone, pick it up on my Mac or HomePod—seamless queuing and playback history everywhere.

Google Maps

Real-Time Traffic & ETA
Live congestion updates reroute me around jams and give accurate arrival times.

Turn-by-Turn Voice Navigation
Clear lane guidance and spoken directions keep me from staring at my phone while driving.

Street View & Indoor Maps
I can preview an unfamiliar restaurant entrance or navigate inside airports and malls.

Slack

Organized Channels
Conversations stay on topic when each project or team gets its own channel.

Threaded Replies
I can handle side-discussions without derailing the main chat.

Rich Integrations
GitHub, Google Drive, Zoom, etc. notifications and actions all live right in my workspace.

###App I would create
Belu is a gamified language‐learning app designed specifically for African languages—from Swahili and Yoruba to Zulu and Amharic—combining bite-sized lessons with rich cultural context. Users progress through levels of vocabulary, grammar drills, and pronunciation exercises powered by speech-recognition feedback, while an AI chat companion lets them practice real-world dialogues (e.g., market bargaining or greeting elders). To deepen cultural immersion, Belu weaves in folk stories, music clips, proverbs, and region-specific dialect modules, and it rewards learners with badges, streaks, and community challenges. Key features include:

Spaced-Repetition Flashcards & Offline Downloads for on-the-go study without connectivity.

Live Peer Exchanges & Tutor Sessions to practice with native speakers.

Custom Learning Paths that adapt to your pace and goals (travel, business, heritage).
Future enhancements might add AR phrase overlays—point your phone at a street sign and instantly see the translation—and location-based meetups that connect learners with local language partners
